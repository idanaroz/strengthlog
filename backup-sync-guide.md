## 🔄 **Common Sync Workflows:**

### **Workflow 1: Development → Production**
```bash
# After adding exercises or workouts locally:
1. localhost:8000 → Settings → Export Data
2. Save: strength-log-backup-2025-07-27.json
3. your-app.vercel.app → Settings → Import Data
4. Upload the backup file
✅ Production now has your latest data!
```

### **Workflow 2: Production → Development**
```bash
# After others use your production app:
1. your-app.vercel.app → Settings → Export Data
2. Save: strength-log-backup-2025-07-27.json
3. localhost:8000 → Settings → Import Data
4. Upload the backup file
✅ Development now has production data!
```

### **Workflow 3: Cross-Device Sync**
```bash
# From any device to any other device:
1. Device A → Settings → Export Data
2. Transfer file (email, Dropbox, USB, etc.)

## 📊 **Data File Format:**

Your backup files contain:
```json
{
  "exercises": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "name": "Right One Hand Assisted Chin Up",
      "notes": "",
      "dateCreated": "2025-07-27T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "workouts": [

      "id": "def456",
      "exerciseId": "abc123",
      "date": "2025-07-27",
      "sets": [
        {"weight": 0, "reps": 8},
        {"weight": 0, "reps": 6}
      ],

## 🚀 **Advanced Tips:**

### **Automated Local Backup:**
```bash
# Your local development has 2 backup methods:
1. GitHub: Automatic every 24h (your personal cloud)
2. Manual: Export anytime (for sharing/migration)
```

### **Production Sharing:**
```bash
# Share your app without exposing your GitHub token:
1. Deploy to Vercel (clean, no sensitive data)
2. Users backup with Export/Import
3. No GitHub account needed for users
4. Your token stays private
```

### **Emergency Recovery:**
```bash
# If something goes wrong:
1. Check GitHub repo for automatic backups
2. Use manual export files as backup
3. Import from any recent backup file
4. All data restored instantly
```
