## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Core Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: localStorage + GitHub backup system
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with glassmorphism, aurora effects, variable typography
- **Fonts**: Inter Variable for dynamic font weights
- **Deployment**: Static files (can be hosted anywhere)

### **Key Technical Decisions**
1. **No Backend**: Pure client-side for zero maintenance costs
2. **localStorage + GitHub Backup**: Fast local operations with cloud persistence
3. **Modern CSS**: Variable fonts, CSS Grid, glassmorphism effects
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline, enhances with internet connection

## 🎨 Design Evolution

### **Phase 1: Clean Foundation** (Initial)
- Basic HTML structure with semantic sections
- Simple CSS with basic styling
- Standard color palette

### **Phase 2: Visual Engagement** (First Enhancement)
- Added vibrant gradients and glassmorphism
- Introduced strong shadows and energetic orange/gold palette
- **User Feedback**: "Don't like, try something else"

### **Phase 3: Sophisticated Minimalism** (Second Attempt)
- Pivoted to refined blue-gray palette
- Reduced gradients and shadows for sophistication
- **User Feedback**: "Can you make it seem very new thing of 2024-2025?"

### **Phase 4: AI-Inspired Modern** (Third Attempt)
- Aurora effects with animated gradients
- Purple/pink/teal glows and dark background
- Variable typography with dynamic font weights
- **User Feedback**: "I'd like you to use more gentle colors"

### **Phase 5: Gentle & Refined** (Current)
- Soft color palette: gentle blues, greens, pinks
- Light cream background (`#fefdfb`)
- Significantly reduced glow/shadow intensity
- Enhanced typography with better text rendering
- Maintained 2024-2025 modern elements

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Data Models**
```javascript
// Exercise
{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "Exercise Name",
  notes: "Optional description",
  dateCreated: "ISO timestamp"
}

// Workout
{
  id: "uuid",
  exerciseId: "exercise-uuid",
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  sets: [{weight: 23, reps: 3}],
  notes: "Optional workout notes",
  dateCreated: "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### **GitHub Backup Structure**
```javascript
// Backup File: strength-log-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json
{
  exercises: [...],
  workouts: [...],
  backupDate: "ISO timestamp",
  version: "1.0"
}
```

### **Storage Strategy**
- **Primary**: localStorage (instant access)
- **Backup**: GitHub repository (24h intervals)
- **Failsafe**: Manual export/import
- **Sync**: Auto-restore on new devices
